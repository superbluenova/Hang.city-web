# How to simplify Radicals
The key to solving radicals is to know what the factors of a number are.
Factors are 2 numbers that multiply by each other to make a number. For example, the number 30 has the factors:
1. 1,30
2. 2,15
3. 3,10
These factors have a distinct use in simplifying radicals. However, first we need to define what a radical is:
A radical is a number square rooted or has the symbol √.
Now, lets start symplifying them!
Lets use an example. 
 √200 can be simplified into what?
200 can be factored into:
1. 1,200
2. 2,100
3. 4,50
4. 5,40
5. 8,25 
6. 10,20
In order to simplify the √200 we have to get the largest factor that is also a perfect square.
A perfect square is a number when it is rooted it gives a whole number.
For the example the farthest we can simplify √200 is 10√2. 
You might notice that we used the factor 2,100 but when we made it into the simplfied radical we used 10 instead. This is because 10 is multiplied by itself to make 100 and 100 is a perfect square.
Thats really all that simplifying radicals is. Make sure to remember that when listing out the factors we have smaller number,bigger number. However when it is simplified in radicals it is usually bigger number √ smaller number.
