Converting a quadratic equation from its standard form, y = ax^2 + bx + c,  to its factored form, y = a(x - r1)(x-r2), 
is a fundamental algebraic technique that simplifies solving for the roots of the parabola. The factored form reveals the 
x-intercepts of the graph, which are the values of x where y = 0.This conversion is essential for understanding the behavior
of quadratic functions and for solving quadratic equations efficiently.

To perform the conversion, start by identifying the coefficients a, b, and c in the standard form. If a = 1, look for two numbers
that add up to b and multiply to c. For example when given y = x^2 + 5x + 6, here c = 6 and b = 5  The numbers 2 and 3 multiply to
6 and add up to 5, so the equation factors to y = (x+2)(x+3) if a doesn't equal 1 or the factors aren't obvious then use the 
quadratic formula. y = -b plus or minus square root b^2-4ac all over 2a. Once the roots r1 and r2 are found then express the 
equation in factored form. (y = (x-r1)(x-r2)).

By converting to the factored form, you directly obtain the roots of the quadratic equation, which are crucial for graphing and analyzing the parabola. This form makes it easier to solve equations, understand the function's intercepts, and explore its properties. Mastering this conversion enhances your ability to work with quadratics in various mathematical applications.
