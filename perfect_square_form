# What is perfect square form?
Perfect square form is when a quadratic is expressed as a perfect square trinomial.
## But what exactly is a quadratic and a trinomial?
A quadratic is just an equation that has x squared or x^2 in it. An example could be:
## y = x^2 + 38x + 8
This would be a quadratic.
A trinomial is an expression with 3 parts. In this example we have the 7, 38, and 8. This is a trinomial.
Now how do you make this equation into a perfect square?
When you have 7 x^2 tiles, 38 x tiles, and 8 ones tiles you cannot make a square using this however if we add a few to both sides then we can.
We can replace the y with a 0 for simplicity.
The equation we now have is:
## 0 = x^2 + 38x + 8
A handy trick we can use to find how many ones tiles we have to add in order to make a square is very simple.
Divide 38 by 2 and then square it. AKA:
## (38/2)^2
This equals to 361. We can use this to say well we need 361 total ones tiles but we already have 8 so then we only really need 353 ones tiles.
We can update our equation to:
## 353 = x^2 + 38x + 361
The reason why we changed the 0 to 353 is because we have to add the same thing to both sides.
# Well great we have this equation, But why does it matter?
This is importatnt because now we can make one binomial multiplied by itself to make the trinomial.
The equation would be:
## 353 = (x+19)^2
